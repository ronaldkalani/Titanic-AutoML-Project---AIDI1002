Model Performance (RMSE),"AutoGluon’s best model (WeightedEnsemble_L2) achieved an RMSE of 938,091. Individual models like LightGBMXT and CatBoost achieved around 974,515 and 998,633, respectively. Lower RMSE indicates higher predictive accuracy.","Established models in housing predictions (e.g., XGBoost or ensemble models) typically reach an RMSE in the range of 50,000 - 300,000 with optimized feature engineering and larger datasets, as seen in benchmark competitions like Kaggle’s House Prices challenge.",,
Model Types,"AutoGluon automatically uses various models (e.g., LightGBM, CatBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks) and combines the best-performing models into an ensemble.","Industry-standard approaches often use similar models (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost) with manual fine-tuning, while ensemble methods are commonly applied in competitive modeling to improve accuracy.",,
Training Time and Inference Speed,"AutoGluon’s ensemble was trained in about 12 seconds with an inference speed of 1680 rows/second for this setup. The training times vary by model complexity (e.g., KNeighborsUnif took 0.01s; NeuralNetTorch took 4.89s).","Real-world applications often use optimized configurations for speed, where models like LightGBM and XGBoost are preferred for their balance of speed and accuracy, especially for tasks requiring near real-time predictions. Training can be more computationally intensive for larger datasets.",,
Real-World Applicability,"The AutoGluon model, with features like square footage and amenities, can quickly estimate home prices and is suited for applications where fast predictions are crucial (e.g., real estate platforms).","Established models are often fine-tuned on larger, diverse datasets and may require extensive feature engineering to generalize across broader markets and diverse property characteristics. Real estate platforms and financial institutions often use such models to support investment decisions and property valuations.",,
